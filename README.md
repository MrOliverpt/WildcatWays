Abstract:
  Wildcat Ways is a fastest-path optimization application specifically designed for Davidson College's campus.
  While other applications like Google Maps and Apple Maps offer similar services, they often make mistakes in overall walking time, as well as miss
  customized paths which Davidson students use and is not in their map.  Wildcat Ways aims to make a "better Google Maps" for Davidson College's campus, so new students, current     students, potential students, and faculty alike can map out their day and rest assured knowing they are walking the fastest path.  In other words, that they are walking the        Wildcat Way.
